## Build

Flutter is installed locally at `D:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat` on this machine:

```powershell
& D:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat pub get
& D:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat run
```

Android release APK:

```powershell
& D:\flutter\bin\flutter.bat build apk --release
```

### Android release signing

Release APKs must use the same release keystore every time. Create one once,
keep it private, and reuse it locally and in GitHub Actions:

```bash
mkdir -p android/app/signing
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore android/app/signing/release.jks -alias csac -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
cp android/key.properties.example android/key.properties
```

Edit `android/key.properties` with the keystore passwords and alias.

For GitHub Actions, add these repository secrets from the same keystore:

- `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: `base64 -w0 android/app/signing/release.jks`
- `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD`
